     * It should generally be avoided in favour of {@link listen(Handler)} so you don't
     * miss any updates, but in many circumstances it makes sense.
     * <p>
     * NOTE: In the Java and other versions of Sodium, using sample() inside map(), filter() and
     * merge() is encouraged. In the Javascript/Typescript version, not so much, for the
     * following reason: The memory management is different in the Javascript version, and this
     * requires us to track all dependencies. In order for the use of sample() inside
     * a closure to be correct, the cell that was sample()d inside the closure would have to be
     * declared explicitly using the helpers lambda1(), lambda2(), etc. Because this is
     * something that can be got wrong, we don't encourage this kind of use of sample() in
     * Javascript. Better and simpler to use snapshot().
     * <p>
     * NOTE: If you need to sample() a cell, you have to make sure it's "alive" in terms of
     * memory management or it will ignore updates. To make a cell work correctly
     * with sample(), you have to ensure that it's being used. One way to guarantee this is
     * to register a dummy listener on the cell. It will also work to have it referenced
     * by something that is ultimately being listened to.
